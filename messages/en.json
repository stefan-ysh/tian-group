        "title": "Advancing Perspectives on Large-Area Perovskite Luminescent Films",
        "desc": "The excellent photoelectric properties of perovskite materials are mainly attributed to their high optical absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetimes, and adjustable band gaps. The ability of these materials to be engineered into large-area films offers significant advantages for practical applications, particularly in the context of portable and wearable technologies. Their lightweight and flexible characteristics further enhance their suitability for a wide range of innovative uses, from consumer electronics to advanced display technologies. Given the promising potential of large-area perovskite luminescent films (PLF), it is crucial to understand both their underlying properties and the mechanisms driving their luminescence. Therefore, this paper primarily summarizes the luminescence mechanisms of large-area PLF, including electroluminescence, photolumines-cence, and mechanoluminescence. It also explores several key fabrication methods in detail. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential applications of these luminescent films, particularly in lightweight, flexible, and wearable technologies, and discusses their prospects in practical applications. By analyzing the current state of research, this paper seeks to underscore the critical role that large-area PLF are poised to play in the future of optoelectronic devices."

        "desc": "Crystalline 4-N, N-dimethylamino-4ʹ-Nʹ-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) is known as an excellent organic nonlinear optical (NLO) material. However, it is vulnerable to damage caused by high-intensity laser irradiation, which severely limits its NLO applications. In this study, DAST molecules were included with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and [email protected]β-CD supramolecular nanowires (NWs), microplates (MPs), and chaotic microcrystals (CMCs) were successfully prepared. All the crystals not only possess excellent NLO properties, but also exhibit greatly enhanced optical damage tolerances (ODTs) and photoluminescence. Under the pumping of a 532-nm picosecond (ps) pulsed laser, we achieved single-mode lasing from MPs and random lasing from CMCs, with thresholds of 55.22 and 88.38 nJ/cm2, respectively. When the laser irradiation had a peak intensity of ~17.5 GW/cm2, which is 8-9 orders of magnitude higher than the DAST bulk-crystal photobleaching intensity, the CMC laser emission intensity retained ~95% of its initial value after 4 h of operation in an ambient atmosphere."

        "desc": "Poly[bis(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) has been developed as one of the most popular hole transport layer (HTL) materials in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the efficiency, thermal stability, and reproducibility of PTAA-based devices are still largely limited by underoptimized chemical interaction, energy level alignment, and contact affinity at the PTAA/perovskite interface. To this end, we introduced a bilateral chemical linker to simultaneously achieve favorable chemical interaction with the PTAA underlayer and form robust coordination bonding with the buried perovskite bottom layer, which beneficially improved the contact affinity, facilitated the hole extraction, well-passivated the interfacial defects, and relieved the nonradiative charge recombination at the HTL/perovskite buried interface. The inverted PSCs modified with interfacial chemical linker exhibited consistently higher power conversion efficiencies and performance reproducibility than that of the PTAA-only devices. Combined with the blade-coated FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 perovskite layer, a champion efficiency of 22.23% has been achieved, which is one of the highest reported values for the inverted PSCs based on the bilayer HTL. The targeted device showed enhanced thermal stability under continuous heating at 85 °C owing to suppressed composition segregation with robust interfacial linkage and consolidation. This work offers a new insight towards making efficient, thermally stable, and reproducible perovskite photovoltaics."

        "title": "Custom Molecular Design of Ligands for Perovskite Photovoltaics",
        "desc": "Perovskite photovoltaics have witnessed overwhelming success owing to their high power conversion efficiency, low voltage deficit, sensitive photoelectric response and good operational stability. However, solution-processed, polycrystalline perovskite films inevitably contain a high density of crystallographic defects, such as uncoordinated ions and dangling bonds at the surfaces and grain boundaries, which can result in charge recombination, thus causing energy loss and impaired device performance. These intrinsic imperfections can be remedied through a chemically induced intermarriage between halide perovskites of soft crystallographic nature and judiciously designed exotic ligand molecules. Utilizing rational molecular design of the component moieties, i.e., the core and tail functional groups, the ligand molecules can be endowed with both more comprehensive and salient advantages to further boost device performance, thus setting perovskite photovoltaics on course for a more prosperous future."

        "desc": "Organic nonlinear optical materials have potential in applications such as lightings and bioimaging, but tend to have low photoluminescent quantum yields and are prone to lose the nonlinear optical activity. Herein, we demonstrate to weave large-area, flexible organic nonlinear optical membranes composed of 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4ʹ-Nʹ-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate@cyclodextrin host-guest supramolecular complex. These membranes exhibited a record high photoluminescence quantum yield of 73.5%, and could continuously emit orange luminescence even being heated at 300 °C, thus enabling the fabrication of thermotolerant light-emitting diodes. The nonlinear optical property of these membranes can be well-preserved even in polar environment. The supramolecular assemblies with multiphoton absorption characteristics were used for in vivo real-time imaging of Escherichia coli at 1000 nm excitation. These findings demonstrate to achieve scalable fabrication of organic nonlinear optical materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields, and good stability against thermal stress and polar environment for high-performance, durable optoelectronic devices and humanized multiphoton bio-probes."

        "desc": "In the research of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a fundamental understanding of the photoelectric conversion process is crucial for exploring mechanisms and optimizing performance, which largely relies on accurately capturing experimental phenomena. Spectral techniques, especially photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurement, photoluminescence (PL) mapping spectroscopy, and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, are highly valued for their ability to provide detailed information about the material's working state. In this Review, we provide an overview of the latest advancements in these spectral techniques in PSC research. We demonstrate their advantages in monitoring the reconstruction of electronic structure, carrier dynamics, evolution of interfacial states, and separation of photogenerated charges in PSCs. Additionally, we discuss how to interpret the underlying physical and chemical processes in perovskite materials based on these spectral characterizations. Ultimately, we look forward to these techniques providing deeper insights into the further development of PSCs and their application in the field of renewable energy."

        "desc": "Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon‐based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade‐coated process. A self‐assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a \"molecular glue\" to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77 % and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64 % was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon‐based PSCs. AS‐assisted interfacial linkage and carbon‐material‐assisted self‐encapsulation enhance the stability of the PSCs, which did not experience performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for over 3000 h."

        "desc": "Lead halide perovskites show great potential to be used in wearable optoelectronics. However, obstacles for real applications lie in their instability under light, moisture and temperature stress, noxious lead ions leakage and difficulties in fabricating uniform luminescent textiles at large scale and high production rates. Overcoming these obstacles, we report simple, high-throughput electrospinning of large-area (> 375 cm2) flexible perovskite luminescent textiles woven by ultra-stable polymer@perovskite@cyclodextrin@silane composite fibers. These textiles exhibit bright and narrow-band photoluminescence (a photoluminescence quantum yield of 49.7%, full-width at half-maximum <17 nm) and the time to reach 50% photoluminescence of 14,193 h under ambient conditions, showcasing good stability against water immersion (> 3300 h), ultraviolet irradiation, high temperatures (up to 250 °C) and pressure surge (up to 30 MPa). The waterproof PLTs withstood fierce water scouring without any detectable leaching of lead ions. These low-cost and scalable woven PLTs enable breakthrough application in marine rescue. Instability of perovskites under light, moisture and temperature stress hinders their potential in real applications. Here Tian et al. demonstrate the high-throughput fabrication of large-area, flexible, color-tunable, waterproof and durable wearable luminescent textiles suitable for marine rescue."

However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare-earth phosphors including (Sr₀.₇₅Ca₀.₂₅)S:Eu²⁺; SrAl₂O₄:Eu²⁺, Dy³⁺ and Sr₂MgSi₂O₇:Eu²⁺, Dy³⁺ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large-area (0.4 m × 3 m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire-rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24-h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost-effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real-world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology."

        "title": "Multidentate Chelation Heals Structural Imperfections for Minimized Recombination Loss in Lead‐Free Perovskite Solar Cells",
        "desc": "Tin‐based perovskite solar cells (Sn‐PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non‐radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep‐level defects in the perovskite film and under‐optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an \"inside‐out\" manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2‐Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep‐level Sn‐related and I‐related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7 % with a small voltage deficit of ≈0.47 V has been achieved for the GAA‐modified Sn‐PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn‐PSCs over 1200 hours."

        "title": "One-Drop Self-Assembly of Ultra-Fine Second-Order Organic Nonlinear Optical Crystal Nanowires",
        "desc": "In this study, we propose a one-drop self-assembly method, which proved capable of successfully preparing 4-N, N-dimethylamino-4'-N'-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) single-crystalline nanowires (NWs). The apparent roughness of the DAST NWs was determined to be less than 100 pm by using a high-resolution atomic force microscope, indicating their ultrafine quality. The DAST NWs also exhibited excellent nonlinear optical properties, including two-photon excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation, which could enable the production of low-cost, low-power-consumption wideband wavelength conversion devices. Thus, the described method may provide a new avenue for organic NW fabrication."

        "title": "Stabilizing Black-Phase CsPbI3 Under Over 70% Humidity",
        "desc": "Recently, all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites have attracted interest. However, the undesirable phase transition of cesium lead halide film from black-phase to yellow-phase in ambient air, especially under high humidity, decreases device stability. The fabrication of black-phase cesium lead halide film still relies on inert gas atmosphere and requires a tedious, energy-consuming post-annealing treatment at high temperature. In this work, we first demonstrate an approach combining crystal redissolution and molecular coordination strategies to prepare black-phase CsPbI3 perovskite films in ambient air with >70% relative humidity. The resultant black-phase CsPbI3 film could maintain its phase purity for more than one month in air, and show good optoelectronic performance."

        "title": "Unlocking Multi-photon Excited Luminescence in Pyrazolate Trinuclear Gold Clusters for Dynamic Cell Imaging",
        "desc": "The family of coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes exhibits abundant photophysical properties, promising for diverse applications. However, their utility in biochemistry is often hindered by large particle size and strong hydrophobicity. Meanwhile, the investigation into multi-photon excited luminescence within this family remained undocumented, limiting their potential in bio-imaging. Herein, we unveil the multi-photon excited luminescent properties of pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters, facilitated by excimeric gold(I)···gold(I) interactions, revealing a nonlinear optical phenomenon within this family. Furthermore, to address issues of poor biocompatibility, we employ electrospinning coupled with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the matrix to fabricate a flexible, durable, transparent, and red emissive film with a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 88.3%. This strategy not only produces the film with sufficient hydrophilicity and stability, but also achieves the downsizing of trinuclear gold(I) clusters from microscale to nanoscale. Following the instantaneous dissolution of the film in the media, the released trinuclear gold(I) nanoparticles have illuminated cells and bacteria through a real-time, non-toxic, multi-photon bio-imaging approach. This achievement offers a fresh approach for utilizing coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes in biochemical fields."

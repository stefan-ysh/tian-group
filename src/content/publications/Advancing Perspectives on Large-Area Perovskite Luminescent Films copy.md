description: |
  The domain of forensic science, dermatology, and regenerative medicine critically relies on the precise replication of human skin details. Nevertheless, conducting on-site analysis poses challenges due to the stringent requirements for stability, accuracy, and the use of safe imaging materials. Current skin imaging methodologies are hindered by the inherent limitations of their hardware components, particularly when it comes to capturing the intricate, micrometer-scale textures of human skin. To address these challenges, we develop a low-cost (<$800), portable nanofiber-based imaging technique (NFIT) using CsPbBr3@HPβCD luminescent nanofibers. NFIT achieves in-situ, multi-regional imaging with ultrahigh-resolution (1450 dpi) and micron-scale similarity (93.24 ± 4.6%), capturing intricate details from sweat pores to large skin areas. Its non-contact design eliminates chemical pre/post-treatments, ensuring safety, hygiene and ease of use. NFIT demonstrates robustness and reliability as it maintains clear imaging under extreme temperature (−50 °C to +50 °C) and over extended periods (Level 3 ≥ 81 days, Level 2 ≥ 108 days). An algorithm was developed to support 3D skin texture model reconstruction, offering a transformative solution for forensic evidence analysis, dermatological assessments, and personalized medicine.

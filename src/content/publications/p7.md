title: 'Large-area waterproof and durable perovskite luminescent textiles'
description: |
  Lead halide perovskites show great potential to be used in wearable optoelectronics. However, obstacles for real applications lie in their instability under light, moisture and temperature stress, noxious lead ions leakage and difficulties in fabricating uniform luminescent textiles at large scale and high production rates. Overcoming these obstacles, we report simple, high-throughput electrospinning of large-area (> 375 cm2) flexible perovskite luminescent textiles woven by ultra-stable polymer@perovskite@cyclodextrin@silane composite fibers. These textiles exhibit bright and narrow-band photoluminescence (a photoluminescence quantum yield of 49.7%, full-width at half-maximum <17 nm) and the time to reach 50% photoluminescence of 14,193 h under ambient conditions, showcasing good stability against water immersion (> 3300 h), ultraviolet irradiation, high temperatures (up to 250 Â°C) and pressure surge (up to 30 MPa). The waterproof PLTs withstood fierce water scouring without any detectable leaching of lead ions. These low-cost and scalable woven PLTs enable breakthrough application in marine rescue. Instability of perovskites under light, moisture and temperature stress hinders their potential in real applications. Here Tian et al. demonstrate the high-throughput fabrication of large-area, flexible, color-tunable, waterproof and durable wearable luminescent textiles suitable for marine rescue.

title: 'Stabilizing black-phase CsPbI3 under over 70 percent humidity'
description: |
  Recently, all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites have attracted interest. However, the undesirable phase transition of cesium lead halide film from black-phase to yellow-phase in ambient air, especially under high humidity, decreases device stability. The fabrication of black-phase cesium lead halide film still relies on inert gas atmosphere and requires a tedious, energy-consuming post-annealing treatment at high temperature. In this work, we first demonstrate an approach combining crystal redissolution and molecular coordination strategies to prepare black-phase CsPbI3 perovskite films in ambient air with >70% relative humidity. The resultant black-phase CsPbI3 film could maintain its phase purity for more than one month in air, and show good optoelectronic performance.

Recently, all-inorganic perovskites have attracted attention due to good thermal stability<sup>[1-12](#ref1)</sup>. Among them, CsPbI<sub>3</sub> has the most desirable optical bandgap (~1.7 eV) for applications in optoelectronic devices<sup>[13-16](#ref13)</sup>. In general, making black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film requires a high-temperature annealing up to 320 °C<sup>[17,18]</sup>, which inevitably raises energy consumption. Though being made at high temperature, the resulting black-phase (α or β phase) CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film still suffers from an undesirable phase transition under ambient conditions<sup>[19,20](#ref19)</sup>. Several strategies have been developed to lower the annealing temperature (90–100 °C)<sup>[20-26](#ref20)</sup>, it is still challenging to stabilize black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> under ambient condition with high humidity and without a tedious annealing process. Herein, we developed a simple crystal redissolution (CR) strategy to make stable black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film in ambient air with high humidity and without post-annealing. 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4′-N′-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) can chemically interact with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> to reduce the formation energy of black-phase and inhibit CsPbI<sub>3</sub> to undergo black-to-yellow phase transition.

**Fig. 1(a)** shows the CR approach. By using the perovskite precursor consisting of PbI<sub>2</sub>, CsI and HI, a light-yellow film was obtained in ambient air, which is due to the existence of both yellow-phase δ-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> and PbI<sub>2</sub>, as evidenced in XRD pattern (Fig. 1(b))<sup>[22](#ref22)</sup>. In contrast, by using CR-derived perovskite precursor (Fig. S1), a mirror-like black CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film was obtained even under 70% relative humidity, which uniformly covered the entire substrate (inset in Fig. 1(c)). Compared with the control sample (Fig.1(b)), there is no PbI<sub>2</sub> signal (12.6°) in XRD pattern (Fig.1(c))<sup>[27](#ref27)</sup>, which is due to a more direct conversion and rapid self-assembly from CsPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals to CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film, rather than the complicated competition among Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, I<sup>-</sup> ions and solvent molecules<sup>[27, 28](#ref27)</sup>. The diffraction peaks at 14.98° and 29.20° are the typical (100) and (200) planes of black-phase β-CsPbI<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, the absorbance of the control film sharply declined after 450 nm, while CR-derived black CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film presents an absorption onset at 733 nm (Fig. S2), which agrees with the previous report on β-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film<sup>[12](#ref12)</sup>. For the control film, inferior surface coverage was observed (Figs. S3(a) and S3(c)). And CR-derived film shows better surface coverage (Figs. S3(b) and S3(d)).

Black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film gradually degraded and underwent phase transition when stored in air for one week, as evidenced by the gradual decrease of absorbance (Fig. S4). To further improve phase stability and optoelectronic properties of β-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film prepared by CR strategy, we introduced the DAST additive (Fig. 1(d)). DAST not only maintains black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> structure, but also slightly enhances the crystallinity and promotes the crystal growth orientation along (100) and (200) planes (Fig. S5). DAST also helps to reduce the grain sizes (100–200 nm) and improve the surface coverage of the resultant β-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film (Fig. S6). DAST molecules can interact with CsPbI<sub>3</sub> via robust bidentate coordination, thus impeding grain growth due to the steric hindrance effect (Fig. 1(e))<sup>[11](#ref11)</sup>. The interaction between DAST molecule and β-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> was studied by FTIR (Fig. S7). The pure DAST shows characteristic signals at 1023 and 1666 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to C=C bond and benzene group, respectively. DAST-modified CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film also shows similar peaks, but with a slight shift, suggesting possible interaction between zwitterion and ions in perovskites<sup>[20](#ref20)</sup>. The DAST-modified CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film was stored at room temperature in air with a relative humidity of ~35%. There was no obvious degradation observed even after one month, as proved by XRD pattern (Fig. 1(f)).

In short, by using the CR strategy, we successfully stabilized the black-phase CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film in ambient air with >70% humidity. DAST can further stabilize the black phase. The approaches in this work will be useful for developing efficient perovskite solar cells.

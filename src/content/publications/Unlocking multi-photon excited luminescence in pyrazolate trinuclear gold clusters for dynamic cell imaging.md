        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
        The family of coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes exhibits abundant photophysical properties, promising for diverse applications. However, their utility in biochemistry is often hindered by large particle size and strong hydrophobicity. Meanwhile, the investigation into multi-photon excited luminescence within this family remained undocumented, limiting their potential in bio-imaging. Herein, we unveil the multi-photon excited luminescent properties of pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters, facilitated by excimeric gold(I)···gold(I) interactions, revealing a nonlinear optical phenomenon within this family. Furthermore, to address issues of poor biocompatibility, we employ electrospinning coupled with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the matrix to fabricate a flexible, durable, transparent, and red emissive film with a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 88.3%. This strategy not only produces the film with sufficient hydrophilicity and stability, but also achieves the downsizing of trinuclear gold(I) clusters from microscale to nanoscale. Following the instantaneous dissolution of the film in the media, the released trinuclear gold(I) nanoparticles have illuminated cells and bacteria through a real-time, non-toxic, multi-photon bio-imaging approach. This achievement offers a fresh approach for utilizing coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes in biochemical fields.

Coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTCs) represent a specific class of metallocycles with metal(I)···metal(I) interactions<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>. Characterized by Au(I)/Ag(I)/Cu(I) cations at the core and bridged by ditopic cyclo rings as anionic bridging ligands, CTCs benefit from the strategic design of the nine-membered ring and ligand substituents<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>, allowing for the attainment of diverse luminescent behaviors or charge-transporting properties<sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>. Since the 1970s, many CTCs have been successfully synthesized and characterized<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup>-<sup>[8](#ref8)</sup>. To date, a wide range of applications for CTCs, such as lighting devices<sup>[9](#ref9)</sup>-</sup><sup>[11](#ref11)</sup>, sensors<sup>[12](#ref12)</sup> <sup>[13](#ref13)</sup>, and photocatalysis<sup>[14](#ref14)</sup>-<sup>[16](#ref16)</sup> have been reported. As an important member.of the CTCs family, gold cyclic trinuclear

compounds (AuCTCs) possess stronger Au(I)···Au(I) bonding energies than Ag(I)···Ag(I) and Cu(I)···Cu(I) interactions<sup>[17](#ref17)</sup>, leading to exceptional one-photon excited luminescence (1PEL) properties. For example, Li's group presented a pyrazolate AuCTC as a single phase white-phosphorescent emitter by modulating monomeric and excimeric dual emissions<sup>[18](#ref18)</sup>. Omary's group reported a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 97.13% achieved by the cupriphication of AuCTCs<sup>[19](#ref19)</sup>. In addition, AuCTCs often serve as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials with a large Stokes shift, offering advantages by reducing fluorescence background interference in microscopy imaging. Combined with their non-toxic nature, strong bio-inertness, and excellent photostability derived from their gold-based composition, AuCTCs hold immense potential in bio-imaging applications.

However, challenges such as considerable particle size and strong hydrophobicity across the majority of the family lead to limited reports on their biochemical applications. Compared to conventional 1PEL, multi-photon excited luminescence (MPEL) represents a nonlinear optical phenomenon wherein a material absorbs multiple incident photons of lower energy simultaneously and subsequently emits light of higher energy<sup>[20](#ref20)</sup>. Using materials with up-conversion MPEL characteristics for bio-imaging through a microscope presents distinct advantages including background scattering suppression, improved longitudinal (z-axis) resolution, and extended penetration depth<sup>[21](#ref21)</sup>-<sup>[23](#ref23)</sup>, opening alternative perspectives to achieve dynamic in vivo bio-imaging<sup>[24](#ref24)</sup>-<sup>[28](#ref28)</sup>. Nevertheless, to date, the manifestation of MPEL phenomena within AuCTCs or even CTCs remains undocumented.

Herein, we synthesized pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters (denoted as Au<sub>3</sub>), representing a member of AuCTCs. We elucidated that Au<sub>3</sub> delivers intense three-photon excited luminescence under NIR irradiation through the eximeric Au(I)···Au(I) interactions, a distinctive luminescence mechanism distinguishes it from conventional organic dyes. Furthermore, to enhance the luminescent performance of Au<sub>3</sub> and address the issue of poor biocompatibility, we employed a synergetic technique combining electrospinning with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) as a matrix. This approach successfully fabricated a flexible, large-area, durable, and transparent film (denoted as Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film), characterized by red phosphorescence with a 14.4% improvement of PLQY over Au<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, the fabrication strategy significantly improves the biocompatibility by reducing the size of Au<sub>3</sub> and enhancing water solubility. An in-depth study was conducted to evaluate the triplet charge transfer states through the analysis of 1PEL, MPEL, excitation dynamics and theoretical simulations, aiming at understanding the underlying reasons for the enhancement of luminescence. As a proof of concept, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was applied for real time, non-toxic, up-conversion multi-photon bio-imaging of live murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 and Escherichia coli (<i>E. coli</i>). Through the instantaneous dissolution of the Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film in the media, the HPβCD-enveloped Au<sub>3</sub> nanopartilces can be released and subsequently actively internalized by the cells, thereby showcasing a capability beyond that of Au<sub>3</sub> alone. Drawing from the discovery of Au<sub>3</sub>'s MPEL properties, this study provides valuable insights into nanoscale fabrication and biocompatibility enhancement, thereby paving the way for the extensive application of CTCs in the biochemical field.

## Results

**The linear and nonlinear optical properties of Au<sub>3</sub>**

The one-step synthesis of Au<sub>3</sub> clusters (structural formula shown in Fig. 1a) using the ligand bis-3,5-(ethoxycarbonyl)−1H-pyrazole is simple, rapid, and delivers a decent yield as reported by Lu et al.<sup>[11](#ref11)</a></sup>. The crystal structure of Au<sub>3</sub> exhibits a one-dimensional chair-stacking pattern (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1), in which the intermolecular Au(I)···Au(I) distances are 3.273 Å or 3.492 Å<sup>[29](#ref29)</sup>. Under UV light irradiation, Au<sub>3</sub> crystalline powder exhibits a broad lower-energy (LE) emission band centered at 670 nm, which partially falls within the near-infrared I region (Supplementary Fig. 2). Coupled with its large Stokes shift, which may reduce biological fluorescence background, Au<sub>3</sub> is highly suitable for bio-imaging applications, particularly in vascular or in vivo imaging. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum shows a single-exponential time constant of 15.58 μs for Au<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 3). It was found that a high concentration (10 g/L) of Au<sub>3</sub> in a clear solution of dichloromethane did not yield detectable luminescence. Conversely, when Au<sub>3</sub> is suspended in water, it exhibits a luminescence phenomenon consistent with that of a solid (Supplementary Fig. 4). This indicates that Au<sub>3</sub> is an AIE material, and the LE band exists in the aggregated state, thereby excluding the possibility of luminescence arising from intramolecular charge transfer or intramolecular Au(I)···Au(I) interaction. The above clues suggest that the LE phosphorescence of Au<sub>3</sub> originates from intermolecular Au(I)···Au(I) interaction in excimers. This aligns with the distinctive phosphorescence mechanism known as aurophilicity<sup>[17](#ref17)</sup><sup>[30](#ref30)</sup><sup>[31](#ref31)</sup>, observed in the majority of AuCTCs<sup><[1](#ref1)</sup><sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>. The effect of the spin–orbit coupling arising from the heavy gold atoms results in a high rate constant and efficiency for intersystem crossing (ISC)<sup>[32](#ref32)</sup>. Additionally, the protection provided by surrounding ligands and the support from the rigid and planar structure keep its luminescent center away from oxygen. This, in turn, maintains the possibility of phosphorescence, with a PLQY of 73.9% under room temperature (Supplementary Fig. 5).

A comprehensive exploration of the 1PEL photophysical properties of Au<sub>3</sub> was undertaken through temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization. As shown in Fig. 1c, the LE band of Au<sub>3</sub> peaked at 275 K and decreased gradually as temperature increased from 275 K to 450 K, accompanied by a red-shift and boarding. This is likely attributed to the variation in the intermolecular Au(I)···Au(I) distances upon heating. Interestingly, when the temperature fell below 150 K, the dominance of the LE band was replaced by a broad and unstructured higher-energy (HE) band centered around 470 nm. This HE band exhibited a nearly identical excitation profile (Supplementary Fig. 6) and showed a reciprocal relationship in the range of 78 K to 150 K with the LE band, implying a common origin between them. Considering the microsecond lifetimes of both the HE and LE emission peaks (Supplementary Fig. 7, and Supplementary Table 1), it is reasonable to infer that these two emission bands originate from alternative excimeric states with different Au(I)···Au(I) distances<sup>[33](#ref33)</sup><sup>[34](#ref34)</sup>.

Excitingly, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images (Fig. 1d) demonstrate that Au<sub>3</sub> exhibits strong MPEL with the irradiation of near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser (the wavelength ranges from 800 to 1000 nm). Note that the absorption band (Supplementary Fig. 8) of Au<sub>3</sub> still lies within the UV region (<400 nm). NIR laser irradiation can still effectively induce luminescence, even though it exceeds its absorption wavelength by more than twice. Hence, we attempted to gain more information about the multi-photon absorption nature of Au<sub>3</sub> through power-dependent up-conversion spectra (Supplementary Fig. 9). A linear log(I)-log(P) relationship can be established with a slope of 3.2 under an incident light of 840 nm, where I is the MPEL intensity and P is the laser power (Fig. 1e). Also, the MPEL spectra of Au<sub>3</sub> under different NIR excitation wavelengths (Fig. 1f) or laser power exhibit a consistent emission band with its 1PEL spectra under UV excitation. This indicates that the relaxation process following both one-photon absorption and multi-photon absorption is consistent. While the luminescence mechanism of conventional MPEL materials, i.e., organic dyes, relies on their intramolecular donor-π-acceptor structure<sup>[20](#ref20)</sup>, it is reasonable to infer that the MPEL behavior of Au<sub>3</sub> follows a similar pattern as its 1PEL. This is attributed to the excimeric Au(I)···Au(I) interactions, rendering it an uncommon case among MPEL materials. More specifically, when subjected to incident light at 840 nm, the dimer of Au<sub>3</sub> absorbs three photons (3PA) simultaneously to achieve upconversion

conversion emission, known as the three-photon excited luminescence. Based on the MPEL spectra (Fig. 1f), the multi-photon action cross-sections (MPACS) of Au<sub>3</sub> were studied using rhodamine B (RhB) as a reference material with known two-photon adsorption cross-sections<sup>[35](#ref35)</sup><sup>[36](#ref36)</sup>. The results indicate that Au<sub>3</sub> has an MPACS ranging from 0.07-5.7 GM under the excitation of 820-890 nm (Supplementary Table 2), which is comparable to that of RhB (0.27-3.0 GM).

To the best of our knowledge, the evidence of MPEL properties in AuCTCs and the broader CTCs family had not been previously documented. Herein, we confirm that the metal-organic compound Au<sub>3</sub> indeed possesses these properties, presenting a promising finding. Given that Au<sub>3</sub> is an AIE material with an outstanding PLQY<sup>[11](#ref11)</sup> and large MPACS, it emerges as an exceptionally compelling candidate for bio-imaging. However, from the CLSM images (Supplementary Fig. 10), it is evident that the sizes of Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals are comparable to those of J774A.1 cells. In the case of <i>E. coli</i>, the sizes of Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals are even ten times larger. The images also demonstrate that <i>E. coli</i> neither aggregates on nor engages in feeding around Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals, suggesting that Au<sub>3</sub> exhibits no attraction to them. The considerable size difference poses enormous challenges in the effective utilization of Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals by cells and bacteria. As a direct evidence, CLSM images reveal that the use of Au<sub>3</sub> for staining both types of live cells did not induce luminescence under 850 nm excitation. Thus, large particle size and low water solubility of Au<sub>3</sub> severely limit its application in the field of chemical biology and there is an urgent need to enhance the biocompatibility of Au<sub>3</sub>.

**Fabrication of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film and morphological characterization**

To solve the issues of large particle size and low water solubility, electrospinning was utilized as a straightforward, rapid and convenient technique<sup>[37](#ref37)</sup> to achieve the incorporation and modification of Au<sub>3</sub>. HPβCD was chosen as the matrix because it features many active hydroxyl groups that allow it to have various kinds of interaction with the guest component, as well as excellent water solubility, non-toxicity, and robust chemical stability. The obtained Au<sub>3</sub> crystalline powder can be blended with 45% HPβCD (w/w, according to H2O) in ambient conditions for electrospinning (Fig. 2a, see details in the Methods section). Upon electrospinning, an Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film measuring 23 cm × 15 cm (Fig. 2b) can be formed, exhibiting uniform bright red emission over the entire film under UV light irradiation (Fig. 2c). Intriguingly, exposure of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film to water vapor for 5 min resulted in its transparency. The transparent Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibited exceptionally high transparency, with a transmittance of 88.1% in the visible region (400-800 nm) (Supplementary Fig. 11). Notably, the fabrication of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD films via electrospinning is both environment-friendly and cost-effective, while also achieving high material efficiency. A minimal amount of Au<sub>3</sub> (5 mg) and organic solvent (0.5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide) is sufficient to produce intense and uniform red luminescence across the entire film. Thus, the overall production cost of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film is as low as 0.0024 $/cm² (Supplementary Table 3). It is in line with sustainable manufacturing principles, providing a practical solution for the production of advanced materials that complies with eco-conscious and economical industrial standard. As a demonstration, a handcrafted red luminescent jellyfish was created from Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, which serves as an inspiration for applications in transparent and flexible displays (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary Fig. 12).

Sequentially, the hydrophilicity and morphology of the film were characterized. From the drop shape analysis (Fig. 2f), it can be seen that the original Au<sub>3</sub> crystalline powder was highly hydrophobic, with a contact angle of 134°. After being prepared into a film, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibited outstanding hydrophilicity, to the extent that the contact angle changed to 26° (Fig. 2g). The dramatic improvement in hydrophilicity observed in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film is likely attributed to the excellent hydrophilic properties of HPβCD. Consequently, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film could be directly dissolved into water while maintaining the luminescent properties of Au<sub>3</sub>. The morphological changes of the film during the electrospinning and transparency process were recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The original white Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film is composed of numerous fibers with diameters ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 μm and pores with diameters ranging from 1 to 10 μm (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 13). Under water vapor treatment, the pores were gradually filled, resulting in the formation of a dense and uniform thin film (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 14). This fact may be ascribed to the promotion of hydrogen bonding interactions between HPβCD oligomers when water molecules filled the surface or pores of the film<sup>[38](#ref38)</sup>. Significantly, the uniform distribution of small-sized Au<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface or interior of the electrospun fibers was achieved through electrospinning. Images obtained from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed numerous bright dots on the interwoven fibers (Fig. 2j), confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) mapping to be primarily composed of gold (Fig. 2k). STEM and TEM images revealed a fascinating phenomenon that the dissolved Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film released Au<sub>3</sub> NPs enveloped within HPβCD vesicles, exhibiting diameters ranging from approximately 50 to 500 nm (Fig. 2l and Supplementary Fig. 15). The Au<sub>3</sub> NPs exhibited a predominantly spherical morphology, with 88.7% having a diameter smaller than 20 nm and an average diameter of 11.2 nm (Supplementary Fig. 16). This demonstrates that, through electrospinning, the size of Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals was significantly reduced to about 1/700 of their original size (ca. 8 μm × 0.6 μm, Supplementary Fig. 17). The presence of intriguing HPβCD vesicles in the solution of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film further provides steric hindrance that consequently facilitates the dispersion of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs. The success in reducing the size of Au<sub>3</sub> to nanoscale and enhancing its hydrophilicity has paved the way for the utilization of Au<sub>3</sub> in various bio-imaging applications.

## Chemical interactions

To gain a deeper understanding of the interaction mechanism between HPβCD and Au<sub>3</sub>, we employed a variety of characterization techniques for analysis. First of all, a suitable polymer matrix that could enhance photoluminescence (PL) performances and fulfill the requirements of biochemical applications is crucial. We evaluated the PL intensity of Au<sub>3</sub> in HPβCD and four commonly used polymers, namely, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyurethane (PU), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polystyrene (PS). It can be observed that the combination of Au<sub>3</sub> with HPβCD resulted in a 49% enhancement of PL intensity (Supplementary Fig. 18). In contrast, other polymers like PVP, PU, and PS resulted in varying degrees of quenching, while PVA induced a slight enhancement in PL intensity. According to this, we investigated the interaction between Au<sub>3</sub> and HPβCD with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. We found that all the 1H chemical shifts of HPβCD3 showed negligible change after mixing Au<sub>3</sub> with HPβCD (Supplementary Table 4 and Fig. 19). Therefore, Au<sub>3</sub> was not encapsulated by the inner cavity of HPβCD. On the other hand, 1H NMR spectra observed a 0.019 ppm downfield variation in the chemical shift of Au<sub>3</sub>'s H1 protons which are around the C=O group (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Also, the 13C NMR spectra delivered a downfield shift of the carbonyl carbons (C3) in Au<sub>3</sub> upon the addition of HPβCD (Supplementary Fig. 20). These observations suggest a change in the chemical environment around the C=O groups of Au<sub>3</sub><sup>[39](#ref18)</sup><sup>[40](#ref40)</sup>. Further clues were found with Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) (Fig. 3b). For Au<sub>3</sub>, the characteristic peak around 1741 cm<sup>-1</sup> could be assigned to the vibration of carbonyl (C=O) group, which was shifted to 1729 cm<sup>-1</sup> in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. After processing the FTIR spectra using second-order derivatives, it is clear that all the wavenumbers of C=O vibration peaks associated with Au<sub>3</sub> decreased in the Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film (Fig. 3c). More importantly, the broad band in the range of 3100 - 3600 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl (O-H) groups, showed a significant shift from 3403 cm<sup>-1</sup> in HPβCD to 3363 cm<sup>-1</sup> in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. This shift was accompanied by broadening and a decrease in intensity. In combination with the above observation, it can be inferred that hydrogen bonds may formed between the C=O groups of Au<sub>3</sub> and the -OH groups of HPβCD. The Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film still retained the characteristic diffraction peaks of Au<sub>3</sub> crystalline powder (Supplementary Fig. 21), confirming that the composition and crystal structure of Au<sub>3</sub> were maintained in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. As the gold atoms are the core for Au<sub>3</sub>'s luminescence, we utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the changes in binding energy of gold in both Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. Compared to Au<sub>3</sub>, the binding energy of Au 4f7/2 characteristic peak in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film increased by 0.7 eV (Fig. 3d). The rise in binding energy suggests a decrease in the electron density of the trinuclear gold core in Au<sub>3</sub> following its complexation with HPβCD. The result of XPS also revealed that the change in the binding energy was accompanied with the broadening of the peak, which further confirmed the size decrease of Au<sub>3</sub><sup>[41](#ref41)</sup>. This is consistent with the observations by TEM.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations<sup>[42](#ref42)</sup><sup>[43](#ref43)</sup> of the frontier molecular orbitals were conducted for Au<sub>3</sub> molecule and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex in water, utilizing the crystal structure obtained from Au<sub>3</sub>. In the optimized geometry of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex at ground state, the hydroxyl group on the outer surface of HPβCD was exposed to the carboxyl group of adjacent Au<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 22). The distance between the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group and the carboxyl oxygen atom of the carboxyl group measured approximately 1.8 Å, affirming the establishment of hydrogen bonds. The visualized electrostatic potential (ESP) maps<sup>[44](#ref44)</sup><sup>[45](#ref45)</sup> (Fig. 3e) revealed the high electron density (shown as the blue region) in the trinuclear gold region of

Au<sub>3</sub> molecule. Upon the complexation of Au<sub>3</sub> with HPβCD, a noticeable reduction in electron density around the trinuclear gold region occurred, which is in line with the XPS characterization. Both computational results and experimental characterization infer that the abundant hydroxyl groups of HPβCD may form a continuous network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. This network can serve as a conduit for effective intermolecular charge transfer and exciton delocalization for Au<sub>3</sub><sup>[52](#ref52)</sup>. The established hydrogen bond network plays a crucial role in facilitating these processes, enhancing the pull-push effects on electrons.

**1PEL properties of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film**

The 1PEL spectrum of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film closely resembles that of Au<sub>3</sub>, with both materials showing a broad emission band centered at 670 nm (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 23). TRPL spectra show an identical single-exponential time constant that can be fitted for both samples. The lifetime of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film (15.19 μs) is slightly shortened compared to that of Au<sub>3</sub> (15.58 μs) at room temperature (295 K) (Supplementary Fig. 24). Since the Au<sub>3</sub> NPs in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film preserves the AIE luminescent properties of Au<sub>3</sub>, it can be inferred that each Au<sub>3</sub> NP contains multiple Au<sub>3</sub> molecules<sup>[29](#ref29)</sup> in an aggregated state. Hence, the transformation by electrospinning effectively increases the number of luminescent units.

Furthermore, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film demonstrates outstanding luminescent efficiency, thermal stability, and long-term stability. Its PLQY reached 88.3%, which represented a 14.4% improvement over that of Au<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 25). Continuously monitoring of the PLQY performances of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film has proved that its luminescent efficiency remained stable over 210 days, without any noticeable deterioration (Fig. 4b). Compared to Au<sub>3</sub>, the radiative decay rate (k<sub>nr</sub>) increased by 7%, while the non-radiative decay rate (k<sub>nr</sub>) decreased by 54% (Supplementary Table 6). These results imply a significant suppression of the non-radiative relaxation pathways in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. Further investigation on the 1PEL properties of Au<sub>3</sub> with the complexation of HPβCD in water showed that the presence of concentrated HPβCD resulted in enhanced luminescence stability and intensity for Au<sub>3</sub>. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 26a, the PL intensity increased proportionally to the concentration of HPβCD. At the same time, normalized photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra demonstrate that increasing the concentration of HPβCD can effectively enhance the excitation efficiency in the region of 280-370 nm (Supplementary Fig. 26b). Due to Au<sub>3</sub>'s large crystal size and strong hydrophobicity, suspended Au<sub>3</sub> in water tends to aggregate and precipitate rapidly, leading to poor luminescence stability. Experimental results showed that the PL intensity of the Au<sub>3</sub> suspension decreased by 48% after 90 minutes (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 27a). In contrast, the PL intensity of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film in water showed minimal decline over the same period (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 27b). As direct evidence that reflects the stabilizing effect of HPβCD on Au<sub>3</sub> in water, zeta potential

measurements revealed that the surface charge of Au<sub>3</sub> in water changed from -21.2 ± 1.7 mV to -29.6 ± 3.0 mV (data are presented as mean values ± S.D.), following the introduction of HPβCD. The improved stability in PL intensity is due to the prevention of Au<sub>3</sub> precipitation in the aqueous solution, facilitated by the increased viscosity from the high concentration of HPβCD.

In comparison with Au<sub>3</sub>, temperature-dependent PL and TRPL spectra of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibited consistent trends (Fig. 4d). Both exhibit a phenomenon where, below 150 K, the HE band (centered around 470 nm) predominates, while above 150 K, the LE band (centered around 670 nm) takes dominance. The HE band and LE band of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibit shortened lifetimes with increasing temperature (Supplementary Fig. 28). At each temperature point, the fitted lifetimes of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film were slightly shorter than those of Au<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Table 7). The temperature-dependent results across various conditions provide additional evidence that the luminescence mechanism originates from the same source as Au<sub>3</sub>. The correlation between the integrated area of LE band and temperature can be graphically represented to calculate the exciton binding energy (E<sub>b</sub>)<sup>[53](#ref53)</sup>, quantifying the forces that binds an electron-hole pair<sup>[54](#ref54)</sup>. The results showed that Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film had a larger E<sub>b</sub> value (476.5 meV) than Au<sub>3</sub> (315.6 meV) (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 29). This suggests the effective inhibition of exciton dissociation, which corresponds to a facilitated radiative recombination rate and improved PLQY<sup>[55](#ref55)</sup>. In addition, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibits luminescence even at elevated temperatures (450 K), indicating excellent thermal stability. This was confirmed by PXRD analysis that both Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film retained their characteristic peaks following the 450 K experiment (Supplementary Fig. 30). This retention signifies their capacity to maintain their crystalline phases under high temperature conditions. The temperature-induced ratiometric change in multiple emission bands leads to a gradual shift in the CIE color coordinates. This characteristic makes Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film a promising candidate for a flexible temperature sensor with a broad sensing range (78-450 K) (Fig. 4f). Thus, comprehensive characterization results indicate that Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film produced by electrospinning exhibits prominent advantages of luminescent performance, large-area, flexibility, hydrophilicity, long-term stability and thermotolerance.

## Excitation dynamics analysis and theoretical simulations

To confirm the hypothesized impact of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex on the excitation dynamics, and to further elucidate the potential factors for improved luminescence efficiency, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA) was employed in this study. With a pumping wavelength of 300 nm, the fs-TA matrix mapping of Au<sub>3</sub> could be plotted out (Fig. 5a). It revealed three absorption bands, namely Band-A (440-500 nm), Band-B (510-560 nm), and Band-C (750-770 nm). The negative band, Band-B, appeared with a central wavelength of 524 nm. It corresponded to a minor absorption in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum of Au<sub>3</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 8), so it could be attributed to ground state bleaching (GSB)<sup>[56](#ref56)</sup>. The positive Band-A exhibited rapid formation with a 200 fs rising time following the excitation (Supplementary Fig. 31a, c). It displayed a very short decay of 0.63 ps accompanied by weak intensity (Supplementary Fig. 32). In accordance with previous reports, intersystem crossing (ISC) or excited state absorption (ESA) processes linked to the triplet state are expected to unfold on a picosecond or longer timescale<sup>[57](#ref57)</sup><sup>[58](#ref58)</sup>. Hence, attributing Band-A to the ESA of the singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>n</sub>) is justifiable, rather than associating it with the long-lived triplet ESA. As Band-A returned to the baseline, the positive Band-C arose gradually within the first 1 ns and then did not return to the baseline within the upper limit of delay time in fs-TA (Supplementary Figs. 33a and 34). The long duration (>7 ns) and significant intensity of Band-C strongly suggest its association with ESA of the triplet state (T<sub>1</sub>→T<sub>n</sub>), which also indicates the occurrence of ISC. After the complexation of Au<sub>3</sub> with HPβCD, the above absorption bands were also observed (Fig. 5b), with the most notable change being the weakening of the positive Band-A and Band-C, representing ESA (Supplementary Fig. 31b, d and Fig. 33b).

Specifically, the complexation with HPβCD, led to a 24% decrease in the rising time of Band-C (Fig. 5c), signifying an accelerated ISC rate<sup>[59](#ref59)</sup>. Nevertheless, the nanosecond delay range of fs-TA is insufficient for fully analyzing Au<sub>3</sub>'s luminescence dynamics, because Au<sub>3</sub> exhibits long-lived phosphorescence associated with the triplet state. Therefore, nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy, as a powerful complementary technique for studying the triplet excited state dynamics in a larger time scale (e.g., ns-μs), has been utilized. For Au<sub>3</sub>, the ns-TA matrix mapping showed a distinct, positive and broad absorption band (Band-D) ranging from 700 nm to 900 nm (Fig. 5d). This band became noticeable in 52 ns post-pumping (Supplementary Fig. 35a). The kinetic spectrum of Band-D exhibited a relative long lifetime, with a fitted lifetime of 5.88 μs at 760 nm (Supplementary Fig. 36). The lifetime of Band-D is comparable to the PL lifetime of Au<sub>3</sub>, once again providing offering strong evidence for ESA in the triplet state (T<sub>1</sub>→T<sub>n</sub>)<sup>[60](#ref60)</sup>. In addition, Band-D encompassed a broad spectral range, indicative of the densely packed energy levels associated with the higher triplet excited states<sup>[61](#ref61)</sup>. The wavelength position of Band-D overlapped with the long-lived Band-C observed in fs-TA spectra, suggesting a correspondence between them. Upon the complexation with HPβCD, the positive Band-D weakened to nearly undetectable (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 35b). Based on the results from two transient absorption characterizations, it can be inferred that the complexation of HPβCD accelerates the ISC rate and suppresses the ESA of Au<sub>3</sub>.

To further verify the above observation, we performed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations to calculate the vertical transition energies. As illustrated in the energy level diagram (Fig. 5f), the computational results indicate that the singlet and triplet energy level distributions in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex have undergone varying degrees of changes compared to the Au<sub>3</sub> molecule (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Firstly, the distribution of singlet excited state energy levels in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex has changed. Computational results

indicated a reduction in the S<sub>1</sub> energy level within Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex, a finding consistent with the observed red shift in the absorption band in the UV-Vis spectra following the incorporation of Au<sub>3</sub> with HPβCD (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 37). Furthermore, the enlarged energy gap between S<sub>1</sub> and the higher singlet excited state S<sub>n</sub> has similarly reduced the probability of singlet state ESA occurring, which aligns with the experimental phenomenon of Band-A obtained in fs-TA. Secondly, the energy levels at which ISC occurs differ in these two systems, taking place between S<sub>1</sub> → T<sub>2</sub> (Au<sub>3</sub>) and S<sub>1</sub> → T<sub>3</sub> (Au<sub>3</sub>-CD), respectively. Hence, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex undergoes less internal conversion and vibrational relaxation during the excitation process. Note that the internal conversion and vibrational relaxation events experienced during S<sub>n</sub> → S<sub>1</sub> or T<sub>n</sub> → T<sub>1</sub> transitions contribute to the loss of absorbed energy. Thirdly, the energy gap between T<sub>1</sub> and the higher triple excited states in Au<sub>3</sub>-CD complex has been enlarged, which could increase the difficulty for ESA to occur, thereby reducing the probability of ESA. This computational result is consistent with the experimental phenomenon of Band-D obtained in ns-TA. In summary, the experimental data and theoretical simulation collectively demonstrate that the modulation of energy levels of Au<sub>3</sub> has been induced by the complexation with HPβCD. Such complexation effectively accelerates the ISC rate and suppresses the non-radiative transitions such as internal conversion and vibrational relaxation, leading to the enhanced PLQY. A potential explanation for the observed phenomenon is that the formation of hydrogen bonds between Au<sub>3</sub> and HPβCD induces an electron push-pull effect. This, in turn, modulates the interaction between Au<sub>3</sub> excimers and consequently alters the energy gap between the first excited state (S<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>) and the higher excited state (S<sub>n</sub>/T<sub>n</sub>) energy levels. Noted the above simulation was based on the optimized model using a single HPβCD molecule and an Au<sub>3</sub> molecule in water. In a real case, the physical form (whether aggregates or monomers), the environmental factors (solvents, temperature, atmosphere, etc.) and other complicated factors would greatly affect the photophysical properties of the system.

**Light up cellular landscapes with Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film**

Beyond its single-photon luminescent properties, Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film also exhibits excellent MPEL performance. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 38, where both Au<sub>3</sub> microcrystals before fabrication and the fabricated Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibit robust MPEL characteristics. More impressively, the MPACS of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film has boosted to 71.3 GM (890 nm excitation) which is 65 times that of 2PACS observed in RhB (Supplementary Fig. 39 and Table 2). Prior research emphasizes the significance of enhancing the push-pull character to improve MPEL performances<sup>[62](#ref62)</sup>. In this context, the hydrogen bonding interaction between Au<sub>3</sub> and HPβCD may alter the electron density of the gold trinuclear core, thereby amplifying its push-pull effects. Due to the high PLQY and MPACS of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, it is highly suitable for achieving visible red light emission within a wide excitation window (from UV to NIR regions), which makes it indeed an outstanding material for both 1PEL and MPEL luminescence. As a proof of concept, we used Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film to facilitate dynamic bio-imaging of live cells. <i>E. coli</i> and J774A.1 cell line were chosen as the representatives of microbial and mammalian cells, respectively. The staining process, as illustrated in Fig. 6a, is straightforward, rapid, and cost-effective (see details in the Methods section), making the Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film stand out among state-of-the-art MPEL materials (Supplementary Table 10). As an exceptional hydrophilic material, the Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film can be instantly dissolved in media and release abundant HPβCD-enveloped Au<sub>3</sub> NPs. Hence, only a small quantity of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film is required, for example, 1 cm²/0.5 mg of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film in a 2 mL cell culture medium, which significantly reduces the costs associated with the use of precious metals. Moreover, using Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film for staining offers the distinct advantage of eliminating the need for rinsing steps, centrifugation or slide sealing procedures. This is attributed to the fact that Au<sub>3</sub> functions as an AIE material, with luminescence occurring only when the material accumulates within the cells. Low concentrations of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs in the culture medium do not induce significant MPEL. Significantly, the active uptake of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs by cells has been visualized using low-voltage TEM. Figure 6b, 6c provide clear evidence, suggesting that J774A.1 cells actively undergo endocytosis of HPβCD-enveloped Au<sub>3</sub> NPs through pseudopodia on their cell membranes. TEM images show the successful internalization of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs within 2 h of feeding, and the accumulation of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs within the cells became apparent with an increasing feeding time (Supplementary Fig. 40). These Au<sub>3</sub> NPs maintained their original size (<40 nm) and were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, showing no specificity towards particular cellular organelles. Furthermore, EDS analysis revealed the existence of gold element (mass fraction >0.1%) in cytoplasm, confirming the successful enrichment of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs within the cells (Supplementary Fig. 41). Interestingly, the presence of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs within some cell nuclei suggests the potential of small-sized Au<sub>3</sub> NPs to penetrate nuclear pores (Supplementary Fig. 42). The above observation implies that Au<sub>3</sub> NPs can internalize and accumulate in J774A.1 through active endocytosis, rather than non-specific passive diffusion. CLSM images showcase the pronounced MPEL of J774A.1 under 850 nm near-infrared laser irradiation (Fig. 6d), providing compelling evidence for the successful illumination of cells by Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film.

Compared to mammalian cells, <i>E. coli</i> possesses a rigid multilayer cell wall, making the uptake of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs as well as the realization of MPEL more challenging. This challenge arises from the very small pore size of <i>E. coli</i>'s cell wall (ca. 4 nm in diameter<sup>[63](#ref63)). Only NPs with a sufficiently small size have the potential to penetrate this barrier, thereby facilitating subsequent intracellular uptake. Impressively, luminescent photos of live <i>E. coli</i> have been successfully captured under 850 nm excitation (Fig. 6e). This evidence indicates that the size of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs from the dissolved Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was sufficiently small to penetrate the cell wall of <i>E. coli</i>, achieving successful internalization. Given that HPβCD is a cyclic oligosaccharide capable of serving as a nutrient source for cells, this state can prompt cells to actively internalize the HPβCD enveloped Au<sub>3</sub> NPs, resulting in the accumulation of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs in the cellular interior. Thus, the internalization and accumulation of Au<sub>3</sub>, can effectively illuminate live cells. Because of the short life cycle and rapid metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>, it is highly conducive to study the metabolic fate of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs within this microbe. We used Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film as a biological stain to observe differences in CLSM imaging after varying feeding durations. The results demonstrate that the bacteria maintained red luminescence even after 24 h of feeding (Supplementary Fig. 43). This suggests that after the internalization of Au<sub>3</sub> NPs, the metabolic activities within <i>E. coli</i> did not completely degrade Au<sub>3</sub>. Even after multiple generations, Au<sub>3</sub> NPs continued to accumulate within the cells, retaining their luminescent properties. The cytotoxicity of Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film under various concentrations was assessed on both types of cells. For <i>E. coli</i>, the impact on its growth of <i>E. coli</i> was monitored using the characteristic absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm (Supplementary Fig. 44). In the case of J774A.1, we used CCK8 validation to study absorbance changes at 450 nm (Supplementary Fig. 45). Both cell viability assays indicate that the presence of Au<sub>3</sub> or Au<sub>3</sub>-CD has no negative impact on the growth of cells within the monitored periods. These findings affirm the low cytotoxicity of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, positioning it as a promising candidate for use as a biological luminescent labeling reagent. Based on the numerous advantages of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, such as outstanding MPEL properties, low cytotoxicity, and the potential for real-time, non-invasive and in vivo bio-imaging, it stands out as an exceptionally promising material for applications in biochemical field.

## Discussion

In summary, our study elucidated the MPEL properties of the pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters. The observed luminescent mechanism under 840 nm NIR excitation is attributed to a three-photon excited up-conversion luminescence which arises from excimeric Au(I)···Au(I) interactions. Furthermore, a flexible, large-area (minimum unit size of 345 cm²), durable, transparent (transmittance of 88.1%) and red emissive (PLQY of 88.3%) film has been successfully fabricated via electrospinning. This Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film exhibits exceptional MPEL properties, marked by a 65-fold enhancement in MPACS compared to RhB. It also demonstrates excellent thermotolerance (>450 K) and long-term stability (>210 days). The enhancement of both 1PEL and MPEL performances is attributed to the modulation of excited state energy levels induced by the hydrogen bonding interactions between Au<sub>3</sub> and HPβCD. Leveraging the technique of electrospinning, Au<sub>3</sub> has been reduced to nanoscale, accompanied by a significant improvement in water solubility, which is a prerequisite and critical step towards biochemical applications. Finally, under the excitation of NIR laser, multi-photon bio-imaging of live cells (J774A.1 and _E. coli_) has been achieved with Au<sub>3</sub> NPs released from the dissolution of Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. Building upon the discovery of Au<sub>3</sub>'s MPEL properties, this study successfully translates and applies it to bio-imaging. This advancement not only enriches our understanding of the photophysical characteristics of AuCTCs but also provides valuable insights for nanoscale fabrication and biocompatibility enhancement strategies within the broader family of CTCs. Consequently, it has opened up diverse avenues for the application of the CTCs family in biochemical fields such as targeted in vivo bio-imaging and bio-sensing.

## Methods

We confirmed that our research complies with all relevant ethical regulations, and the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology/Instrumental Analysis & Research Center/School of Chemistry, Sun Yat-sen University, approved the study protocol.

### Materials

Hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), triethylamine (Et<sub>3</sub>N), bis-3,5-(ethoxycarbonyl)−1H-pyrazole (HL), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Macklin Inc. Gold (tetrahydrothiophene) chloride (THT) was purchased from Shanghai Acmec Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Solvents such as ethanol, acetone and ether were purchased Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory.

### Synthesis of cyclo-trimer Au(I) bis-3,5-(ethoxycarbonyl)−1H-pyrazolate (Au<sub>3</sub>)<sup>[11](#ref11)</sup>

Firstly, a solution of HL (0.212 g, 1 mmol) in 30 mL of ethanol was prepared. Subsequently, a 30 mL acetone solution containing Au(THT)Cl (0.320 g, 1 mmol) was mixed with the ethanol solution. Following the addition of a few drops of anhydrous Et<sub>3</sub>N, white precipitates were formed immediately. The resulting suspension was stirred for an additional 30 minutes to ensure complete reaction. The white precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with 10 mL ethanol in a high yield (0.286 g, yield 46%). The as-prepared Au<sub>3</sub> crystals showed bright red emission under the excitation of 254 nm UV light.

### Fabrication of flexible Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film (15 cm × 23 cm in size)

Firstly, HPβCD was dissolved in 2 mL water at a mass ratio of 45%. PVP can be used as an additive at a mass ratio of 5% to the aforementioned solution to increase the viscosity. Subsequently, 8 mg of Au<sub>3</sub> powder was dispersed in 0.5 mL of DMSO, achieving a uniform suspension through ultrasonication. The electrospinning ink is obtained by mixing the above HPβCD solution and Au<sub>3</sub> suspension with stirring at room temperature. Moving on to the electrospinning process, the prepared electrospinning ink was loaded into a syringe equipped with a metallic needle. The syringe was positioned horizontally on a syringe pump in the electrospinning apparatus (E02, Foshan Qingzi Precision Measurement and Control Technology Co., Ltd) which was enclosed in a plexiglass box. The tip-to-collector distance was set as 10 cm. Subsequently, a high voltage (10 kV) was applied to the conductive needle using an electrospinning apparatus, while grounding the aluminum foil collector. Electrospinning was then carried out at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/h and a rotation speed of 600 rpm/min for 2 hours. The electrospinning process was conducted at a temperature range of 20−26 °C and a relative humidity between 40 and 70%. To prepare a transparent Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, the resulting white Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was placed over water vapor for uniform vapor deposition. The fibers in the film underwent rapid cross-linking, and after 5 min, a transparent Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was obtained.

### Characterization

An FLS1000 Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) was used to test the steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime (TRPL) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).The temperature-dependent measurement was conducted with DN Optical Cryostats (Oxford Instruments) as an apparatus on FLS1000. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was performed on Empyrean (Malvern Panalytical). Detailed PXRD settings were as follows: a 2θ range of 5−50°, a step size of 0.026° and a step rate of 0.7 s. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were conducted on Lambda950 (Perkin Elmer) with an integrating sphere. The transmittance evaluation was conducted on Lambda950 by fixing the transparent Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film on a quartz plate. The morphological features of the Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film were characterized using a Regulus 8230 (Hitachi) cold-field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for observing the microstructures of the film and the dissolved solution were captured with a Tecnai G<sub>2</sub> F30 (FEI) transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra and mapping (EDS) was obtained by the X Flash (Bruker) detector which was equipped on the Tecnai G<sub>2</sub> F30 TEM. Photos of the contact angle were obtained on a DAS100 drop shape analysis system (Krüss).

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained by Nicolet 6700-Continuum (Thermo Fisher). For FTIR characterization, the Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film sample was prepared without PVP. The nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR) spectroscopy was performed on AVANCE III HD 600 (Bruker). All the samples were dissolved in a mixed solvent of deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6) (Merck) and deuterated chloroform (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) (Merck) in a volume ratio of 3:7 in order to obtain a clear solution for NMR testing. The binding energy of gold on the surface of Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film were characterized on an ESCALAB Xi<sup>+</sup> (Thermo Fischer) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Zeta potential measurement were performed on a zeta sizer EliteSizer (Malvern Instruments). For Zeta potential tests, fresh samples were prepared by suspending Au<sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 100 mg/L in water. In the compared sample with the addition of HPβCD, the mass ratio between Au<sub>3</sub> and HPβCD was 1:100. The confocal laser scanning microscopy images were taken using LSM 880 NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss), in which λ<sub>ex</sub> = 850 nm, λ<sub>em</sub> = 550−750 nm, 140 fs/pulse, 80 MHz repetition. The images captured at 850 nm excitation were pseudo-colored (red) for better distinction.

### Calculation of multi-photon action cross-section (MPACS)

The following formula was used to estimate the MPACS of Au<sub>3</sub> and Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film using Rhodamin B (RhB) as the reference,

$$\frac{F_{(reference)}}{F_{(sample)}} = \frac{(\eta\sigma)_{reference}\cdot\rho_{reference}\cdot(I_{00})_{reference}}{(\eta\sigma)_{sample}\cdot\rho_{sample}\cdot(I_{00})_{sample}}\tag{1}$$

where F<sub>(reference)</sub> is the measured MPEL peak intensity of the reference material, RhB. F<sub>(sample)</sub> is the measured MPEL peak intensity of Au<sub>3</sub> or Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. η is the PLQY, σ is the multi-photon absorption cross-section, ησ is the multi-photon action cross-section, ρ is the molar concentration, and I<sub>00</sub> is the peak intensity of the input laser pulse. Typically, I = 25.1 mW (for both the sample and the reference); The data of σ<sub>(reference)</sub> of RhB varies depending on the excitation wavelength; η<sub>(reference)</sub> = 0.01 (RhB powder); η<sub>(sample)</sub> = 0.739 (Au<sub>3</sub>) or 0.883 (Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film); ρ<sub>(RhB)</sub> = 1.04 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and ρ<sub>(sample)</sub> = 3.35 × 10<sup>-6</sup> (Au<sub>3</sub>) or 3.24 × 10<sup>-7</sup> (Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film).

### Calculation of exciton binding energy (E<sub>b</sub>)

The exciton binding energy (E<sub>b</sub>) was calculated from the Arrhenius plot, according to the following Eq. (2):

$$
I(T) = \frac{I_0}{1 + A \exp\left(\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\right)} \tag{2}
$$

where <i>I<sub>0</sub></i> is the integrated PL intensity at 0 K, <i>k<sub>B</sub></i> is the Boltzmann constant, and <i>A</i> is the Arrhenius coefficient.

### Transient absorption spectroscopy characterization

Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy measurement was performed on a pump/probe system by equipping a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire laser source (Coherent Legend, 800 nm, 150 fs, 5 mJ·pulse<sup>-1</sup>, and 1 kHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems LLC) spectrometers. A 75% portion of the 800 nm output pulse was frequency-doubled in a BaB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (BBO) crystal, which could generate 300 nm pump light. Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the output was concentrated into a sapphire window to produce a white light continuum (400–780 nm) probe light. Time-resolved kinetic spectra were recorded with a delayed time ranging from 0 fs to 7.5 ns. For fs-TA measurements, fresh samples were prepared by suspending Au<sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 1000 mg/L in ethanol. In the samples where HPβCD was added, the mass ratio between Au<sub>3</sub> and the added HPβCD was 1:50.

Nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy measurement was performed on an LKS80 laser flash photolysis system (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). The fourth harmonic mode of the Nd:YAG laser (266 nm) was used as the pump light source. A xenon lamp (150 W) was used as the probe light source. The pump light from the pulsed laser was directed onto a sample cuvette at a right angle to a probe light. The variation of optical signal upon irradiation was recorded by a Philips PM3323B digital oscilloscope. The absorption spectra were recorded with a probing range of 600–900 nm at 5 nm step. Time-resolved kinetic spectra were recorded with a delayed time ranging from -4 μs to 36 μs. For ns-TA measurements, fresh samples were prepared by suspending Au<sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 25 mg/L in ethanol. In the samples where HPβCD was added, the mass ratio between Au<sub>3</sub> and the added HPβCD was 1:50.

### Multi-photon bio-imaging tests

<i>E. coli</i> and J774A.1 were chosen as the typical cells for bio-imaging tests. J774A.1 cell line was bought from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). By maintenance of J774A.1, RPMI1640 media (Merck) was used and supplied with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a T75 flask in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> supplement. After 24 h incubation, 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was introduced to each portion (2 mL) to label J774A.1 for 2 hours or more. The stained J774A.1 cells were then transferred to a confocal dish for assessing the staining performance using confocal laser scanning microscopy. <i>E. coli</i> (BNCC133264) was bought from BeNa Culture Collection. For the growth of <i>E. coli</i>, the Luria-Bertani medium consisting of 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl, and 5 g/L yeast extract was prepared. Following autoclaving (0.5 MPa, 121 °C, 15 min), the medium's pH was adjusted to 7.4 ± 0.1. The bacteria were initially cultured for 24 hours and subsequently subcultured in closed serum bottles in triplicate, with an inoculum size of 10%. The bottles were agitated at 100 rpm in an incubator, maintaining the temperature at 37 ± 0.5 °C. After 24 h incubation, 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was added to each bottle (10 mL) to stain the <i>E. coli</i>. The <i>E. coli</i> (0.2 mL of the supernatant) were collected for evaluating the stain performance using a confocal laser scanning microscopy.

### TEM imaging of cells

Cell ultrastructure imaging was conducted using a HT7800 TEM (Hitachi), operating at an accelerating voltage of 60–80 kV. The quantitative EDS measurement was performed by the 120 kV Tecnai G2 Spirit TEM (FEI) with X Flash (Bruker) detector. To ensure optimal specimen preparation, a systematic procedure was followed. Firstly, J774A.1 cells were treated with Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film (500 mg/L). After incubation periods of 2, 4, and 12 h, the culture medium of each specimen was discarded, and glutaraldehyde was rapidly added. Cells were gently scraped, collected into centrifuge tubes, and the glutaraldehyde was then replaced, allowing for a 2-hour fixation period. The specimens were rinsed three times with a 1% osmium tetroxide solution, followed by dehydration in a gradient series of ethanol (50%–70%–80%–90%–95%–100%). Following dehydration, the solvent was substituted with epoxy resin in a gradually increasing concentration. The specimens were infiltrated, embedded and polymerized at 37 °C for 12 h and 60 °C for 48 h. The hardened resin, along with the embedded specimens, was sectioned to a thickness of 60 nm using an ultramicrotome and mounted on copper grids. Subsequently, the sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, which were finally ready for TEM imaging.

### Cell viability assay

The impact on the growth of E. coli with Au<sub>3</sub> or Au<sub>3</sub>-CD films in a concentration of 0.5–2.0 g/L was monitored at different feeding times using the characteristic absorption peak at a wavelength of 600 nm. The impact on the growth of J774A.1 with Au<sub>3</sub> or Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film was assessed with the CCK8 assay. Before treatment, J774A.1 was digested into single cells by using trypsin-EDTA. Cells were counted and pipetted into 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. After 24 h, cells were treated with the following concentrations: 0.5 g/L Au<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 g/L Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, 1.0 g/L Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film, and 2.0 g/L Au<sub>3</sub>-CD film. On the day of the CCK8 assay, 20 µL of CCK8 solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. Subsequently, the absorbance of the 96-well plate was monitored with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.

### Computational details

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using Gaussian 16 programs<sup>[43](#ref43)</sup> throughout this manuscript. Geometric optimizations of the reactants, transition states, and products were performed using PBE<sub>0</sub> functional<sup>[42](#ref42)</sup>. The standard def2-SVP basis set<sup>[44](#ref44), [45](#ref45)</sup> for all atoms. An effective core potential associated with the def2-SVP basis set<sup>[46](#ref46)</sup> was used on Au atoms. Harmonic vibration frequency calculations were performed for all stationary points to confirm them as local minima. Approximate solvent (water) effects were taken into consideration based on the IEFPCM continuum solvation model<sup>[47](#ref47)</sup> in all calculations. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were performed on the optimized structures at the same theoretical level. The first 30 S<sub>0</sub> → S<sub>n</sub> and S<sub>0</sub> → T<sub>n</sub> vertical transitions were calculated for each model. The analyses of electrostatic potential (ESP) on molecular vdW surface were finished by Multiwfn<sup>[49](#ref49)–[51](#ref51)</sup>. The above isosurfaces were rendered by VMD program<sup>[48](#ref48)</sup> based on the outputs of Multiwfn. Abbreviations in this section: LUMO or L, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; HOMO or H, highest occupied molecular orbital; f, oscillator strength; vdW, van der Waals.

### Statistics and reproducibility

The morphological images of different samples were repeated independently at least three times, which all showed similar morphological features of the samples as shown in Fig. 2<sub>h</sub>–l, 6<sub>b</sub> and Supplementary Figs. 13–15, 17, 40–42. The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of different samples were repeatedly independently at least three times, which all showed similar results as demonstrated in Figs. 1<sub>d</sub>, 6<sub>d</sub>, e and Supplementary Figs. 10, 38, 43.

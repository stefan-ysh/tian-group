title: 'Perovskite crystals redissolution strategy for affordable, reproducible, efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics'
description: |
  High-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) normally rely on costly, high purity (>99.99%), air-sensitive raw materials that vary batch-to-batch. The perovskite films and devices derived from conventional raw materials mixture method suffer from inferior reproducibility of optoelectronic properties and performance, as well as discounted promise towards low-cost scalable manufacturing. Distinguished from the direct mixing of raw materials, the preparation of perovskite films with precursors made by the redissolution of perovskite crystals holds the promise to make PSCs more affordable, reproducible, efficient and stable. The resultant perovskite films inherit the exceptional characteristics of the parent perovskite crystals, such as high crystallinity, high purity, accurate stoichiometric ratio, and low trap-state density, as well as good ambient and phase stability. Herein, we summarize recent progress on the employment of the perovskite crystals redissolution strategy for achieving low-cost, efficient perovskite-based solar-to-electricity conversion, which will help both popularize the redissolution strategy and reveal unprecedented advantages gained by its adoption.

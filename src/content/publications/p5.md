description: |
  Organic nonlinear optical materials have potential in applications such as lightings and bioimaging, but tend to have low photoluminescent quantum yields and are prone to lose the nonlinear optical activity. Herein, we demonstrate to weave large-area, flexible organic nonlinear optical membranes composed of 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4ʹ-Nʹ-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate@cyclodextrin host-guest supramolecular complex. These membranes exhibited a record high photoluminescence quantum yield of 73.5%, and could continuously emit orange luminescence even being heated at 300 °C, thus enabling the fabrication of thermotolerant light-emitting diodes. The nonlinear optical property of these membranes can be well-preserved even in polar environment. The supramolecular assemblies with multiphoton absorption characteristics were used for in vivo real-time imaging of Escherichia coli at 1000 nm excitation. These findings demonstrate to achieve scalable fabrication of organic nonlinear optical materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields, and good stability against thermal stress and polar environment for high-performance, durable optoelectronic devices and humanized multiphoton bio-probes.

        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
        Organic nonlinear optical materials have potential in applications such as lightings and bioimaging, but tend to have low photoluminescent quantum yields and are prone to lose the nonlinear optical activity. Herein, we demonstrate to weave large-area, flexible organic nonlinear optical membranes composed of 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4ʹ-Nʹ-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate@cyclodextrin host-guest supramolecular complex. These membranes exhibited a record high photoluminescence quantum yield of 73.5%, and could continuously emit orange luminescence even being heated at 300 °C, thus enabling the fabrication of thermotolerant light-emitting diodes. The nonlinear optical property of these membranes can be well-preserved even in polar environment. The supramolecular assemblies with multiphoton absorption characteristics were used for in vivo real-time imaging of Escherichia coli at 1000 nm excitation. These findings demonstrate to achieve scalable fabrication of organic nonlinear optical materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields, and good stability against thermal stress and polar environment for high-performance, durable optoelectronic devices and humanized multiphoton bio-probes.

Organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have attracted a great deal of research interest owing to their tremendous potential in a variety of
applications such as microlasers, on-chip optical communication, lighting, displaying, biological sensing, and THz generation<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>–<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup>, etc.
As a benchmark of NLO materials, 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4ʹ-Nʹ-methylstilbazolium tosylate (DAST) crystal is of particular interest due to its high electro-optic coefficient<sup>[5](#ref5)</sup>–<sup>[7](#ref7)</sup>, high NLO susceptibilities, and good second-harmonic generation (SHG) property. DAST is a donor-πacceptor (D-π-A)-type molecule, which has excellent two-photon or multiphoton absorption (2PA or MPA) characteristics that could emit visible light<sup>[8](#ref8)</sup>–<sup>[9](#ref9)</sup>. In addition, DAST is a highly polarized compound with a non-centrosymmetric arrangement and large dipole moment, and its energy level and excited-state processes are very sensitive to the molecular environments, which severely limits its availability and practical application<sup>[5](#ref5)</sup>–<sup>[10](#ref10)</sup>. First, the strict anhydrous atmosphere is of paramount importance for fabricating high-quality DAST crystals, otherwise, the molecular structure with a non-centrosymmetric arrangement will be destroyed and the NLO activity of materials will be lost<sup>[11](#ref11)</sup>–<sup>[13](#ref13)</sup>. Secondly, the DAST molecules suffer from notorious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and other nonradiative decay channels like the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, which largely limits the improvement of luminescent performance. Worse still, DAST crystals have a low photobleaching threshold under excitation by blue, green, and even near-infrared (NIR) light because of the
occurrence of trans–cis isomerization of stilbazolium<sup>[10](#ref10)</sup>–<sup>[11](#ref11)</sup>. Besides, most DAST crystals grown on the rigid substrate are tiny, fragile, and easy to be destroyed during the peeling-off process, thus limiting their potential to be applied in integrated optical/photonic/optoelectronic devices.

Over the past two decades, several fluorescent and phosphorescent materials have been designed and applied in bioimaging<sup>[14](#ref14)</sup>–<sup>[16](#ref16)</sup>. However, most of the applicable bioimaging systems are based on inorganic materials such as transition metal chalcogenides quantum dots/nanocrystals (i.e., FeSe, ZnS, CdSe, CdTe, etc.)<sup>[17](#ref17)</sup>–<sup>[22](#ref22)</sup> or organic/inorganic hybrid materials<sup>[23](#ref23)</sup>,<sup>[24](#ref24)</sup> which contain noble or toxic metals, and have limitations in structural and functional tunability, as well as large-scale production owing to the high costs and harsh fabrication conditions. Compared with their inorganic counterparts, pure organic NLO materials exhibited unique advantages for bioimaging<sup>[25](#ref25)</sup>, including easy fabrication, wide spectral coverage with tunable absorption and emission spectra, mechanical flexibility, and excellent biocompatibility<sup>[26](#ref26)</sup>–<sup>[29](#ref29)</sup>. Motivated by previous works, the DAST materials with SHG and two-photon-excited fluorescence (2PEF) properties, namely, utilize low photon-energy visible/NIR excitation to produce high photon-energy emissions<sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>,<sup>[30](#ref30)</sup>, showcased great potential to be used as fluorescence probes for realizing real-time bioimaging with high spatial resolution. To the best of our knowledge, unfortunately, achieving water/heat/light-stable organic NLO supramolecular materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and persistent NLO activity is still very challenging and intractable, not to mention the real application of DAST materials in high-resolution bioimaging<sup>[31](#ref31)</sup>.

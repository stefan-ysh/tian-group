title: 'Advancing Perspectives on Large-Area Perovskite Luminescent Films'
description: |
  The excellent photoelectric properties of perovskite materials are mainly attributed to their high optical absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetimes, and adjustable band gaps. The ability of these materials to be engineered into large-area films offers significant advantages for practical applications, particularly in the context of portable and wearable technologies. Their lightweight and flexible characteristics further enhance their suitability for a wide range of innovative uses, from consumer electronics to advanced display technologies. Given the promising potential of large-area perovskite luminescent films (PLF), it is crucial to understand both their underlying properties and the mechanisms driving their luminescence. Therefore, this paper primarily summarizes the luminescence mechanisms of large-area PLF, including electroluminescence, photolumines-cence, and mechanoluminescence. It also explores several key fabrication methods in detail. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential applications of these luminescent films, particularly in lightweight, flexible, and wearable technologies, and discusses their prospects in practical applications. By analyzing the current state of research, this paper seeks to underscore the critical role that large-area PLF are poised to play in the future of optoelectronic devices.

title: 'Unlocking multi-photon excited luminescence in pyrazolate trinuclear gold clusters for dynamic cell imaging'
description: |
  The family of coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes exhibits abundant photophysical properties, promising for diverse applications. However, their utility in biochemistry is often hindered by large particle size and strong hydrophobicity. Meanwhile, the investigation into multi-photon excited luminescence within this family remained undocumented, limiting their potential in bio-imaging. Herein, we unveil the multi-photon excited luminescent properties of pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters, facilitated by excimeric gold(I)···gold(I) interactions, revealing a nonlinear optical phenomenon within this family. Furthermore, to address issues of poor biocompatibility, we employ electrospinning coupled with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the matrix to fabricate a flexible, durable, transparent, and red emissive film with a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 88.3%. This strategy not only produces the film with sufficient hydrophilicity and stability, but also achieves the downsizing of trinuclear gold(I) clusters from microscale to nanoscale. Following the instantaneous dissolution of the film in the media, the released trinuclear gold(I) nanoparticles have illuminated cells and bacteria through a real-time, non-toxic, multi-photon bio-imaging approach. This achievement offers a fresh approach for utilizing coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes in biochemical fields.
